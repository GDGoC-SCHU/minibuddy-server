**minibuddy** is our submission to the GDG on Campus Solution Challenge 2025 â€” a cheerful **talk-driven mental health checker** designed for people living alone. Through light, everyday conversations, minibuddy helps users check in on their well-being by providing feedback on anxiety, depression, stress, and memory.

This repository contains the server-side code for minibuddy, built with two containerized components: `app-server` and `ai-server`.  
They run on Cloud Run, communicate via gRPC, and integrate **Gemini** for conversation intelligence through the AI component.
